## Tutorials on Building-level Data Analytics

**Prepared by [Manisa Pipattanasomporn](https://mpipatta.github.io)**

During the past several years, I have been involved in smart building research. I would like to create this set of tutorials to share the knowledge that I learned, related to building-level data analytics, building-level load forecasting and more.

This page was created in December 2019, and contents will be added as they become available!

* [Work with CU-BEMS Data: Chamchuri 5 building](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mpipatta/mpipatta.github.io/blob/master/CHAM5.ipynb)

This notebook explores the CU-BEMS dataset of Chamchuri 5 building. Chamchuri 5 is a seven-story academic office building located at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Recorded data are: power consumption (kW) of individual AC units, lighting and plug loads in each zone, on each floor of the building, together with corresponding indoor temperature (deg C), humidity (%) and illuminance (lux) in each zone. 

* [Working with time-series data](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mpipatta/mpipatta.github.io/blob/master/tutorials/TimeSeriesData.ipynb)

Python is powerful to handle time series data. In this tutorial, we will learn: how to import time-series data, how to deal with missing time-series data, how to filter a selected time range, how to visualize time-series data and how to resample time-series data.

* Building-level load forecasting with RNN family (coming soon)
