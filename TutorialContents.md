## Tutorials on Building Data Analytics

During the past several years, I have been involved in smart building research. I would like to create this set of tutorials to share the knowledge that I learned, related to building-level data analytics, building-level load forecasting and more.

This page was created in December 2019, and contents will be added as they become available!

* [Work with CU-BEMS Data: Chamchuri 5 building](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mpipatta/mpipatta.github.io/blob/master/CHAM5.ipynb)

This notebook explores the CU-BEMS dataset of Chamchuri 5 building. Chamchuri 5 is a seven-story academic office building located at Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Recorded data are: power consumption (kW) of individual AC units, lighting and plug loads in each zone, on each floor of the building, together with corresponding indoor temperature (deg C), humidity (%) and illuminance (lux) in each zone. TThe goal is to demonstrate what analysis can be performed on the dataset and visualize some of the data. The data used here can be downloaded at https://sgrudata.github.io/ (coming soon).

* Building-level load forecasting with RNN family (coming soon)
